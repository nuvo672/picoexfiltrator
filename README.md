# picoexfiltrator

This script appears to be a sequence of commands designed for automated interaction with a Windows operating system. It starts by opening a PowerShell window and executing a series of commands. 

These commands include creating and navigating to a temporary directory, downloading files from specific URLs, extracting archived files, running an executable, and performing various actions within a web browser window. Afterward, it defines a PowerShell function named "Upload-Discord," which seems to be intended for sending data to a Discord webhook, including a file attachment.

The script proceeds to use this function to upload an HTML file to Discord. Finally, it performs several cleanup actions such as deleting temporary directories, removing registry entries, and clearing the recycle bin before exiting.
